title: Pod network loss
---
Pod network loss is a Kubernetes pod-level chaos fault that causes packet loss in a specific container by starting a traffic control (tc) process with netem rules to add egress (or ingress) loss.
- It tests the application's resilience to lossy (or flaky) network.

## Usage
<details>
<summary>View fault usage</summary>
<div>
It tests the application's resilience to lossy (or flaky) network. It simulates degraded network with varied percentages of dropped packets between microservices, loss of access to specific third party (or dependent) services (or components), blackhole against traffic to a given AZ (failure simulation of availability zones), and network partitions (split-brain) between peer replicas for a stateful application.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes> 1.16.


## Default validations

The application pods should be in running state before and after chaos injection.

## Fault examples

### Common and pod-specific tunables
Refer to the [common attributes](../../common-tunables-for-all-faults) and [pod-specific tunables](./common-tunables-for-pod-faults) to tune the common tunables for all fault and pod specific tunables.

### Network Packet Loss

It defines the network packet loss percentage to be injected in the targeted application. You can tune it using the `NETWORK_PACKET_LOSS_PERCENTAGE` ENV. 

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/pod-network-loss/network-loss.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# it injects network-loss for the egress traffic
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: pod-network-loss
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # network packet loss percentage
        - name: NETWORK_PACKET_LOSS_PERCENTAGE
          value: '100'
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          value: '60'
```
### Destination IPs And Destination Hosts

The network faults interrupt traffic for all the IPs/hosts by default. The interruption of specific IPs/Hosts can be tuned via `DESTINATION_IPS` and `DESTINATION_HOSTS` ENV.

- `DESTINATION_IPS`: It contains the IP addresses of the services or pods or the CIDR blocks(range of IPs), the accessibility to which is impacted.
- `DESTINATION_HOSTS`: It contains the DNS Names/FQDN names of the services, the accessibility to which, is impacted.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/pod-network-loss/destination-ips-and-hosts.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# it injects the chaos for the egress traffic for specific ips/hosts
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: pod-network-loss
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # supports comma separated destination ips
        - name: DESTINATION_IPS
          value: '8.8.8.8,192.168.5.6'
        # supports comma separated destination hosts
        - name: DESTINATION_HOSTS
          value: 'nginx.default.svc.cluster.local,google.com'
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          value: '60'
```

### Network Interface

The defined name of the ethernet interface, which is considered for shaping traffic. You can tune it using the `NETWORK_INTERFACE` ENV. Its default value is `eth0`.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/pod-network-loss/network-interface.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# provide the network interface
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: pod-network-loss
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # name of the network interface 
        - name: NETWORK_INTERFACE
          value: 'eth0'
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          value: '60'
```

### Container runtime and socket path

It defines the `CONTAINER_RUNTIME` and `SOCKET_PATH` ENV to set the container runtime and socket file path.

- `CONTAINER_RUNTIME`: It supports `docker`, `containerd`, and `crio` runtimes. The default value is `docker`.
- `SOCKET_PATH`: It contains path of docker socket file by default(`/var/run/docker.sock`). For `containerd`, specify path as `/var/containerd/containerd.sock`. For `crio`, speecify path as `/var/run/crio/crio.sock`.

Use the following example to tune it:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/pod-network-loss/container-runtime-and-socket-path.yaml yaml)
```yaml
## provide the container runtime and socket file path
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: pod-network-loss
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # runtime for the container
        # supports docker, containerd, crio
        - name: CONTAINER_RUNTIME
          value: 'docker'
        # path of the socket file
        - name: SOCKET_PATH
          value: '/var/run/docker.sock'
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          VALUE: '60'
```
